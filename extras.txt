how to allow only web browser connections?

first deny all outgoing connections

sudo ufw default deny outgoing

Then you must allow outgoing traffic on both port 80 and 443 with these commands:

sudo ufw allow out to any port 80
sudo ufw allow out to any port 443

since web browsing require access to a DNS server you must also allow port 53:

sudo ufw allow out to any port 53
